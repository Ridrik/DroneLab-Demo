## Overview

**DroneLab** is a 3D drone visualization and simulation environment developed in **C++**, using **OpenGL** for rendering and **Dear ImGui** for its real-time interface.  
It focuses on **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)** — providing a lightweight yet expressive tool for visualizing flight trajectories, telemetry, and control algorithms in an interactive 3D space.

---

### 🎯 Key Features
- Main multicopter vehicle types available with configurable allocation
- Waypoint following with configurable parameters  
- Real-time visualization of flight dynamics  
- Replay and telemetry visualization  
- Adjustable GNC parameters  
- Lightweight and intuitive interface  
- (Experimental) MAVLink and ROS2 Interfaces, including simulation backend mode where it accepts actuator commands

---

### 🧠 Purpose
DroneLab is designed for **educational use**, **entry-level research**, and **GNC/Flight visualization**.  
All present demo versions are distributed privately for evaluation purposes.
